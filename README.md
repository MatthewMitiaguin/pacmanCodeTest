Pacman Test IE - Matthew Mitiaguin

# Test Data

I used the same test data given in test, however to input it I did it slightly differently.

Please view "TestCase1.png" and "TestCase2&3.png" screenshots as examples of how I input the code.

The initial and secondary place is done over three lines instead of the one line

e.g.

0
0
NORTH

However every other command works the same - 1 command per line
e.g. The first test case turns from

a)
PLACE 0,0,NORTH

MOVE

REPORT

Output: 0,1,NORTH

** to **

PLACE
0
0
NORTH
MOVE
REPORT
Pacman is facing : NORTH
Pacmans X is : 3
Pacmans Y is : 3

# Running the code
You will need to run this code in a Java IDE - I personally used Eclipse
